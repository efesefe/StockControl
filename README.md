# StockControl

In this code Ä± aimed to manipulate and control stocks of particular stores.
When we start the code for the first time we encounter to a menu which allows us to decide between options.

We can input stock information of a store of our choice. This actually does same thing as Update stock choice. But we can think of it as initial information about stores. Basically you choose a store and item by their ip that is assigned to them. And you can enter amount of that item.

With Stock control with product id and store id, option we can check a store's stock information for a particular item in the stock. by using their ids.

When you choose List products option you came accross four other options. Which are:
  1- List all products of store n, which we can use to see all stock information of our choosing. (n stands for store id)
  2- List products exist in store n but not store m, if you choose this option you should enter 2 ids of 2 different stores (or you can enter same store ids but there will be no proper output). The program will compare these stores to find products that exist in the first store but does not exist in the second store.
  3- List products exist in both store n and store m, this option excepts 2 ids just like the 2nd option. But this time program will output the items that exists both first store and second store.
